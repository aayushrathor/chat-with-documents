# Pros and Cons

Understanding the benefits and challenges of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is critical for those using or developing large language models (LLMs).

## Advantages of RAG

- **Cost-effective Training**: Unlike intensive fine-tuning processes, RAG requires less computational power and data. You just need to index documents into the knowledge base.
- **Access to Various Knowledge Sources**: RAG merges the knowledge within its own parameters with that from external databases. This results in more accurate answers and lessens incorrect creations, especially in tasks like question-answering.
- **Enhanced Scalability**: RAG is adept at handling large datasets and intricate inquiries thanks to vector databases. It surpasses conventional LLMs, which are constrained by their context window size, by retrieving information from a broader range.

## Challenges Faced by RAG

- **Risk of Hallucinations**: Even RAG can make mistakes. If the database lacks certain information, the model might guess the response, which can lead to inaccuracies.
- **Managing Scalability**: While RAG handles large databases well, increasing the database size can complicate quick and efficient data retrieval.
- **Potential Biases in Data**: Biases in the retrieval database can taint the responses, raising ethical concerns. Fortunately, startups like Lakera are developing tools to spot and lessen biases in AI systems. By using these tools, developers and researchers can improve their models for fairer outputs.
